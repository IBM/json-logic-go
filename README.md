# json-logic-go

This parser accepts [JsonLogic](http://jsonlogic.com/) rules and executes them in Go.

The JsonLogic format is designed to allow you to share rules (logic) between front-end and back-end code (regardless of language difference), even to store logic along with a record in a database. JsonLogic is documented extensively at JsonLogic.com, including examples of every [supported operation](http://jsonlogic.com/operations.html) and a place to [try out rules in your browser](http://jsonlogic.com/play.html).
